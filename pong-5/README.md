# pong-5 (Class Update)

This update will update the code to use classes in order to scale code more effectively.

A Class is a blueprint for creating bundles of data and code that are related.

e.g. "Car" class can have fields -> attributes describing the car (e.g. brand, model, color)
"Car" can have methods that define its behaviour (e.g. accelerate, turn, honk) (these are functions)

Objects are instantiated from these class blueprints
