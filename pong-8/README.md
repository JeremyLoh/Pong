# pong-8 (Score update)

This update adds scores for the players and checks for a win condition. A victory screen shows up when a player has scored 10 points.

The serving of balls will alternate: if player 1 wins a point, player 2 will serve in the next round. If player 1 wins the game (10 points), when the game restarts, player 2 will start serving.
